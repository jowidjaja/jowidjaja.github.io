          <p>I wrote a fantastic, somewhat lengthy review and accidentally swiped down on the GoodReads app. It happened to delete everything I wrote with no remorse. So I begin again.</p.>
          <p>Bob Iger, CEO of Disney enterprises began his journey in 2005, just at the beginnings of my childhood. I didn’t realize the immense influence he wielded on everything that I loved as a kid. 
                I believe it was a twist of fate (similar to which he references) that allowed me to read this book at this time in my life. It was the right book in the right time. 
                I was struggling with my own leadership dilemmas and it seemed this book related to my struggles in many ways.</p>
          <p>While this book should not be known for its rhetoric, I will say that the way it was written aided in portrayal of Iger’s character. 
                It seemed as though I was conversing with a calm, smart, and experienced man, who had a sense of humor deeply embedded within his spirit. While reading, I laughed aloud on several occasions and felt powerful waves of nostalgia. 
                The most profound element was his interactions with Steve Jobs, founder of Pixar (I had no idea!). 
                Through the language and the private moments we as readers got to experience, I saw the brilliance, exceptional creativity, and the intense passion that defined Jobs and the heartfelt tragedy that followed his career. 
                In my opinion, Iger could have omitted the future acquisitions following Pixar and honestly I wish he did because it began to feel as though it was just adding to a list. 
                His most meaningful moments were those near the beginning of his career and with the struggles to defend Disney’s soul that lied within its animation. This, to me, is what Disney is. 
                I believe his future expansions, while economically significant to him and his corporation, made the company impersonal and perhaps has lead to some of the emotional friction between myself and the corporate name. </p>
          <p>While the beginning of his book were really powerful, I believe the end, with acquisition after acquisition, was redundant and unnecessary, hence the four stars instead of five. 
                I would rate just the first three-fifths of the book five stars if possible. Regardless, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and I may in fact read it again. 
                I laughed, nearly cried, and felt the elements of hope, creativity, and passion that has defined the Disney legend for decades.</p>

          <h3>The Upside of Stress</h3>
          <h5>Book Review, <span class="w3-opacity">Aug 11, 2022</span></h5>
        </div>

        <div class="w3-justify">
          <img src="images/McGonigal_TheUpside.jpg" alt="The Upside of Stress" style="width:40%" class="w3-padding" ALIGN="right">
          <p>In preparation for what is suppose to be the hardest semester of undergraduate year, I took it upon myself to discover what the academic world had to say about stress. In previous years, I found that my approach to stress has usually taken the form of escapism and self-destructive habits. I was searching for not just better coping mechanisms, but also hope. 
            I already knew what I was in for. I mean, come on, the book title kind of says it all. Stress can be good. But I still felt the need to be convinced. I thought the book would be wildly scientific, and while it did contain the logos, I was surprised by the amount of anecdotal evidence provided which made the book very enjoyable. 
            What I found even more surprising was that this book was not at all to argue that stress is good, but harkened towards the positive impact a mindset shift could have. While reading, I felt as though I was becoming more enlightened, not in my conscious, but in my subconscious which is often times the hardest to convince.  I remember thinking that this book defines the difference between intelligence and wisdom. Researchers utilized intelligence to define stress as bad, harmful, toxic, and dangerous. And perhaps this was just as that is what their studies demonstrated. But it seemed as though the researchers could not see the bigger picture which is where wisdom comes in play. How does one share this information with the public? How does these animal studies relate to human experiences? Are there elements of stress that come in different forms and thus can not be compared in that way? Anyone can look at a mouse model and call stress bad, shaming humanity for something they cannot prevent. Any reporter can use terrifying headlines about how stress causes health issues. But wisdom tells us what is true in a scale more wholistic and true than anything simple intellectual rationality can provide. And by the fruits of the intelligent versus the wise, we can see what is truly best for humanity. One leaves an individual in a state of panic (one that I have visited myself) and shame while the other encourages growth and resilience. 
           </p>
           <p>Anyways, some of my favorite bits are not necessarily revelations, but a phrase that simplifies my own thoughts into something much more digestible. McGonigal writes, "a stressful life is often a meaningful life; stress challenges us to find the meaning in our lives" (67). I am so thankful for this sentence as it has protected me against a futile battle against stress through escapism which is summed up quite nicely by the quote by Richard Ryan, Veronika Huta, and Edward Deci, "The more directly one aims to maximize pleasure and avoid pain, the more likely one is to produce instead a life bereft of depth, meaning, and community" (McGonigal 84). I will also say, that I believe my own experiences have pointed to the true-ness of this statement. This past semester, studying organic chemistry had caused me to battle with myself, my insecurities, and even my faith. But that experience also made me resilient and more amazed at how God works within my life. 
            Another interesting way McGonigal frames difficult moments is in the context of something greater. Like a hiker suffers the death zone to reach the summit of Mount Everest, we can also embrace difficulty if we remember the larger picture. Thus, analogy this very beautifully helps one understand the importance of values and "greater than" goals in one's life. Also, just as beautiful are the statements she introduces to the reader that can replace the complaints the inner critic normally makes. "May we all know our own strength" (170) is such a heartfelt and empathetic statement to say to yourself. It is a kudos to the bravery of others while recognizing that fire of hope within yourself. It is empowering and yet not ignorant of the suffering at hand. 
           </p>
           <p> For the most part, I found the philosophy of this book align with the one I currently hold for myself. I say this as McGonigal references that mindsets are "not black-and-white truths about the world" (220) which is something I fervently agree with. There are a few bits that I don't necesarrily take issue with, but I feel as though it is an overextension of her argument about stress. However, I will implement them into my life to see if it really does make a difference.
            One part that was a really unique perspective was the discussion of if good was a result of trauma. Her response states that the growth and good are not belongings of the trauma, but are a result of you - "your strengths, your values, and how you choose to respond to adversity" (201). While I don't necessarily agree that the good is purely human as I see it more in the spiritual lens, I think this is a really good way to explain the precarious relationships between struggle and positive growth. 
            I began this book with a mindset towards stress that was isolating and honestly quite depressing as I felt inadequate. In her book, she references interventions given to students and the fruits of these interventions regardless if they remembered the content. Reading this book gave me hope that I too can begin to embrace stress rather than fear it.
